## Personal Projects
**IN PROGRESS: Building Blocks**

A Unity package intended for developers that features simple-to-implement "building blocks" that may be required for a range of games. Each building block contains the documentation describing the intended use as well as limitations or considerations developers must take when using in their own games.

**Text-Based YahtzeeÂ©-like Dice Game**
A simple dice game played within the cmd that follows the rules of the Hasboro dice game YahtzeeÂ©. Select between single player against the computer or a local two-player versus. Roll, choose dice to hold, and score all with keyboard commands. The game ends when both players have marked their scores and the higher score wins!
